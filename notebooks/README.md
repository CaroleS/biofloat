Jupyter Notebooks for biofloat 
------------------------------

To execute the code in these Notebooks follow [these instructions to install biofloat](../README.md).
The biofloat package must be in your Python search path.  If you installed with `pip install biofloat`
it will be in your path.  If you are operating from a clone of the repository you should set your
PYTHONPATH environment variable to that directory, e.g.:

    export PYTHONPATH=~/dev/biofloatgit

Change to this directory on your computer and execute this at the command line:

    ipython notebook

A browser window should open with a directory listing of the notebooks for you to select. Here is a brief description
of the Notebooks that were created during the development of the biofloat module:

#####  First Notebooks, used to test local cache file operation and Pandas capabilities
1. build_biofloat_cache.ipynb
2. explore_cached_biofloat_data.ipynb
3. explore_surface_oxygen_and_WOA.ipynb

##### More Notebooks
